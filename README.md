# Soil Moisture Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict soil moisture based on temperature, humidity, and soil type.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- `temperature`: The temperature in degrees Celsius.
- `humidity`: The humidity percentage.
- `soil_type`: The type of soil (categorical variable).
- `soil_moisture`: The measured soil moisture percentage.

## Files

- `Soil_Moisture_Prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `soil_moisture_data.csv`: The dataset used in this project.

## Usage

To run the notebook, you need to have Jupyter installed along with the required Python libraries. You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
