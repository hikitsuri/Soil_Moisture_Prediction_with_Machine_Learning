# Soil Moisture Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project predicts soil moisture levels using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, and soil type, with the goal of predicting soil moisture based on these inputs.

## Dataset
The dataset `soil_moisture_data.csv` includes:
- `temperature`: Temperature in °C.
- `humidity`: Relative humidity in %.
- `soil_type`: Type of soil.
- `soil_moisture`: Measured soil moisture content.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hikitsuri/Soil_Moisture_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Soil_Moisture_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Soil_Moisture_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
